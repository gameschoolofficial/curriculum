5 Best:

Running low on top selling product, fulfillment sees inventory is moving faster than normal, notifies inventory, inventory confirms, they go to accounting and says we need mulah and i need it for this product, accounting double checks budget and they get the money to purchase more inventory so as to not go into a back order situation.

sale order come in pick/pack/ship, customer changes mind, order is changed, changes mind again, added other products, now have to ship a pallet instead of a couple of cartons, fulfillment notifies everyone about pallet, pallet  gets shipped out.

huge sale event with major drop shipper, everyone knows in advance, inventory got extra budget from accounting to get excess stuff, because of that fulfillment is prepared and everything goes out on time.

customer pre-orders a bunch of items to be shipped in the future, everything gets budgeted, orders the product, everything shows up, because everything was ordered in advance everything gets out on time

fedex makes delivery in morning, has a couple of returns, gets processed into inventory, inspected, mint condition, gets relayed to accounting, adjusts inventory
, PO in same shipment from a vendor, process inventory, notify accounting to account for deposits and freight, etc


5 Worst:

Unknown back order, sales order comes in, shows inventory in stock, not there, customer cancels order
shipment comes in, three returns, all were returned due to shipping wrong color, received PO from vendor, PO was 1000 units all they received were 900, one carton was smashed, so only 850 were in good condition.

event is planned, inventory thinks they have enough packaging supplies, sale does better than expected, run out of packaging and shipping supplies, canâ€™t get product out on time, get charge backs from company doing sale.

SO comes in for single unit, fulfillment picks carton with four units on it thinking it is only one, customer does not return additional units.  Inventory is off and you lost money.

shipment comes in from vendor, product needs to be labeled correctly, inventory needs to be adjusted, inventory is adjusted but wrong labels are put on product, fucks everything up, customer gets shipped wrong item, inventory count is off, do we need to reorder, budget is off
