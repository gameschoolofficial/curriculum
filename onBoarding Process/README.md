# on Boarding Process for new students


Game-School GitHub submission Process and Standards

You are required to have your homework done by the following class time or otherwise stated by the teacher. Your homework, projects and journal will be submitted to your gitHub repository.

Source Tree Submissions:

Name your exercises to match the class exercise
Always use the README to leave notes, bugs and problems within your homework.


You will be asked to present your games, demos and homework in front of the class, so it’s very important that we can simply pull down your latest game commits.


The following directories will help keep all of your work in one place so we can easily go through your work.
Game projects

Name this directory:  Game-School Game Project
Create a README file here that describes your game concept, your mechanic and your outstanding list of tasks, bugs and notes for your game.

Special Assignments
Sometimes, we will ask you to do special programming, art or game design exercises for the classroom.  Please name the folder as “Special Exercises”

Journaling, Blogging and writing
It is both important and necessary for you to journal your experience through game design and development, so we ask every student to start journaling what they learn, and how they actually developed their game.

If you feel comfortable with sharing some of your blogs, you can use any of the blog systems out there, but we recommend Tumblr since we can post pictures, and that will be very important in showing how you developed certain game functions and ideas.
