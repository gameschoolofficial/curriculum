Data Types

String
  Are always
int
  These data types are used to manipulate integer numbers, so whole numbers, with no decimal.
float
  These data types will store decimal values up to xx spaces and take up much more memory to store than an integer.  Use floats when you need to use decimal points, otherwise use integers to reduce the memory allocation.
