# Week ONE overview


Data Types

String
  Are always
int
  These data types are used to manipulate integer numbers, so whole numbers, with no decimal.
float
  These data types will store decimal values up to xx spaces and take up much more memory to store than an integer.  Use floats when you need to use decimal points, otherwise use integers to reduce the memory allocation.

Variables

Declaring a variable allows Unity to know that you will be using this object as a way to store simple data types of information. You do not have to set the actual value upon declaration.  Declaration of variables tend to be at the top of the page, where you can list ALL of your variables so they are easily accessible.  

Strings are always surrounded by double or single quotes.  

```C#
String playerName = "";
int score = 0;

```

Assigning a value to your variable

```C#
String playerName = "";

```



Operators:

<=
>=


Conditional phrases:
Sometimes in a program, you need to check for certain values.

```C#
if(condition){
  playerName = "Anonymous";
  score = 100;
} else {
  playerName = "";
  score = 500;
}
```
